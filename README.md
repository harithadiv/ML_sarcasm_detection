# ML_sarcasm_detection
Group project on machine learning models to detect sarcastic comments on Reddit 

Dataset taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/sarcasm

4 models were explored: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Long short-term memory(LSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT).
These models were then compared and analysed to find which model performs the best to predict sarcasm in texts. 

Relevant parts done by me: SVM implementation and evaluation, Logistic Regression and SVM analysis in presentation slides
